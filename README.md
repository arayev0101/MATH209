# Hello, this is a project in Math 209. The project guidelines are as follows:
# 4. **Bank Interest Calculator**. This project reinforces user input, mathematical calculations, and visualization using Python libraries. Prompt the user to input the initial amount (A), interest rate (r), time period in years (t), and the frequency of compounding (p). The program should return the resulting amount and include graphs comparing different compounding frequencies, such as yearly, monthly, daily, and minutely.

# Idea: Money in, money out, working deposits, paycheck, monthly allowance/withdrawals. 
# Realized gain, buying power vs inflation…

# (A) Explain  in writing in your own words (help with AI is ok) what you will do.  Handwrite (or latex) the mathematical theory (which you might learn first). Define and name key variables that you will use in the code. Keep the notation consistent. 
 # (B) Decide where you will be working on the project (notebook, online editor, compiler, cloud). 
# (C) Write down a prototype, first without AI help. You may get stuck. Try the textbook first. Then try little help from AI language models. 
# (D) Be sure to include comments explaining the code. 
# ( E) Include exception when a user gives data or format that the program does not expect. 
# (F) Run tests by offering your working code to a peer in class. Then collect feedback. 
# (G) Finalize your project, by adding short documentation how to use the code through some interesting examples. 

# Presentation:

# Show people how it works, but the math behind it. Edge cases: negative numbers, letters. “If you save money from drinks daily.” compounded.
